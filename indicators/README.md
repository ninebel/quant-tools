# Indicators
A tiny script implementing technical analysis indicators

All indicators implemented came from the book 'Come into my trading room' written by Dr. Alexander Elder

The file 'Example.py' has an example of usage, it uses the indicators script to generate two Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and plots a graphic showing the result.
